LONG TERM QUESTION: I'm not feeling a yes on the long term question. After 2 years of taking this seriously and trying, there's still a part of me that feels like something isn't right with our dynamic. That we are not where we need to be for me to make long term promises or commit to big moves.

COMPATABILITY: I intellectually understand you love me, but most of the time it's not landing on an emotional level, especially not day-to-day. I don't feel like I'm getting the acts of service or words of affirmation from you that I need. The fact you are aware of this, and I'm still not getting what I need makes me realise we have a fundamental issue.

STABILITY: I see a pattern of transcience in you that scares me. It's not just the jobs, cumminities and travel. There's something volatile and unpredictable which can be exciting, but also makes me worried for you and for us. 

COMMUNITY: I know the world I've built around me is not perfect. But when so much of it causes tension for us, it's really hard for me. I'm sure this is partly feulled by tension due to our geographic circumstance, but either way it hurts. Furthermore, I'm not seeing you building a better kind of community that I want to be part of, and this feels important for me to see.
