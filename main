LONG TERM QUESTION: I'm not feeling a yes on the long term question. After 2 years of taking this seriously and trying, there's still a part of me that feels like something isn't right with our dynamic. That we are not where we need to be, for me to make long term promises.

COMMITMENT PRESSURE: The pressure on me to commit to a 5+ year plan is putting our relationship under pressure. Before I can think about any of that, I want to see us making progress on our challenges and working together. I want to work towarsd a shared world. And I'm not feeling any closer to seeing that world. 

COMPATABILITY: I intellectually understand you love me, but most of the time it's not landing on an emotional level, especially not day-to-day. I don't feel like I'm getting the acts of service or words of affirmation from you that I need. The fact you are aware of this, and I'm still not getting what I need makes me realise we have a fundamental issue.

IT'S NOT ABOUT MONTREAL: I'm not feeling I have waht I need from this relationship to make a leap.

STABILITY: I see a pattern of transcience in you that scares me. It's not just the jobs, cumminities and travel. There's something volatile and unpredictable which can be exciting, but makes me worried.

CONTROL AND EXTREMES:
